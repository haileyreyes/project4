			<p>How would you describe Hailey and Geo's relationship?</p>
			<br></br>
			<p>“Hailey and Geo’s relationship is more of a friendship than anything. Geo is known to be with other girls so he isn’t someone I see Hailey being with.”-Sarah C.</p>
			<p>"Hailey she seems annoyed of Geo"-Kalista R.</p>
			<p>“They are like two best friends. They are really close but I feel like here are times where Hailey is very annoyed with their relationship” -Hailey’s mom</p>
			<p>"Well Hailey can tolerate Geo, but I think Hailey deserves someone that has the same intentions as her; meaning, Geo,is gay and clearly not bisexual. Also, he has had multiple “girlfriends” (three in fact) and has been in a marital relationship with Kaiya."-Kasey N</p>
			<p>“Hailey and Geo’s relationship is one to be concerned about. Geo says he knows “EVERYTHING about her”, including her home, family and friends. Personally I think this is very concerning and that Hailey should get a restraining order immediately. He not only has multiple partners, but also partners of both gender.-Melanie A.”

			<p>Have you had any "romantic" encounters with Geo?</p>
			<br></br>
			<p>“Yes, he tried to kiss me right  right before you asked me this question” -Cady T</p> 
			<p> "Yes, he saw me five minutes ago and he said, “I missed you my queen.” I would say that this PRETTY romantic because a random person would not say that to me." -Kasey Nguyen
			<p>"Yes, he always slow dances with me in the middle of the kitchen floor almost everyday after school. He like to play very sensual music. Sometimes when no one’s home, we cuddle and watch crime shows together. He used to be my personal pillow." -Amber Keyes</p>
			<p>“Yes, Geo was my Manz for a while until i left him for kassidy but we secretly are still in love” -Benny</p>
