  <h3> All in all Geo and I should not be a couple. Quite honestly we don't have a lot in common and we are two very different people. Not to mention the fact that late last year Geo and I found out that we were cousins by marriage. For us to date would be really weird. Geo has also had a lot of history with other girls. There have been many quotes addressing just how much he switches up who he likes or who he wants to be with. I have no interest in dating Geo. If you would like to see the other side of this debate, visit Geo's website where he explains why he and I should be a couple.</h3>

  <center><h3> Next time you see Geo tell him to stop trying to date Hailey. She is not interested.</h3></center>
